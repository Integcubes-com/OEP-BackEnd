Notes: Although this RIR is titled Civil Foundation and Corrosion Management, the focus here is only on soil settlement issues.
Earlier in  2021 it was soil settlement mainly in the Transformer area and selected other areas. This work is almost completed.
 
However recently soil settlement issues have been observed in other areas. This is under review, and a plan of action is being developed.
Therefore even after the Transformer area is addressed, this RIR would still be open, until the rest of the areas are addressed.

Marsh Comments: Many areas around the plant is treated according to the approved solution and
budget, others are progressing and will be finalized soon as per the plant team
feedback

Insurance Recommendation	
It is recommended for site to introduce an annual (as a minimum) maintenance routine to check the DC L.O. pump set performance, looking for deviations from rated discharge pressure, speed and power consumption. The results should be compared to factory or site acceptance test records and plotted for trending.

Concern on the above recommendations.
The DC lube oil pump shall be in service for 90 minutes. -Suppling unfiltered oil to the turbine bearing which is not recommended also
