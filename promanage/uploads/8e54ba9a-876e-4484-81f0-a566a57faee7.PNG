"PB1-22-0186-BP-EN-01","4488","Permanent: Apply the software patch in SPPA-T3000 provided by Siemens","After the correction of the configuration or if no deviation has been found by the scan, there is still the risk that an unintended value can be loaded into the system whenever the failsafe software configuration is changed.
For a sustainable solution independent of configurations which were corrected or configurations where no deviations where found, Siemens Energy recommends installing a software patch in SPPA-T3000. The patch is designed to eliminate the unintended system behavior for future configuration of a failsafe system and FM458 in your installed SPPA-T3000 system. The patch as well as the service for installing the patch is provided by Siemens Energy.
Please refrain from performing any configuration changes in the failsafe system or turbine control system until the SPPA-T3000 patch has been installed by a Siemens Energy authorized expert.","Al Dur 2-DCS","Jaber Abduljalil Moosa","Upgrade","Normal Operation","Project Company","In Progress","Patch to be made available.

"SB05/2017E","858","Modify Axial Displacement Probe Setting","A detailed report with recommendations for the probe adjustments was made by sebenzana. The report states as follows

1.	The turbine tripped a number of times during its run-up to 3000 and before synchronization, due to the trip limit of -0.40 mm being breached (This is the limit imposed on the non-active side of the thrust bearing)
2.	During sebenzana's time on site they had no way of adjusting the alarm and trip values or electronically adjust the registered probe readings so the only course of action was to carry out physical adjustments on the probes themselves.
3.	With the machine pushed hard onto thrust (LP turbine jacked towards the Condenser) they adjusted the probes such that they registered a valve of +0.20 mm compared to 0.00 mm previously. This ensured that a surge reading of -0.20 mm was registered during the machines runup to 3000 rpm compared to trip values of -0.40 mm being registered prior. Thus unfortunately gave the indication that was sustained 0.20 mm wear on the thrust bearing.
4.	They measured the thrust float of the LP shaft at 0.35 mm and compared that to design which was stipulated at 0.70 mm.
5.	The original alarm and trip settings does not account for any thrust float.
Hence forth the following needs to be carried out.
1.	Thrust bearing's thrust float needs to be confirmed on-site
2.	The thrust probes (Bently Nevada  3300 XL 8mm Proximity probes needs to be reset) - Recommended voltage gap should be -9.5 VDC. This would allow for detection of 1.07 mm movement in the Surge direction and 0.97 mm movement in the Trust direction.
3.	Once the probes are set to -9.5 VCD the DCS registered values are to be adjusted to 0.00 mm
4.	The subsequent alarm and trip values should be adjusted such that:
1.	Thrust Trip: 0.40 mm
2.	Thrust Alarm: 0.20 mm
3.	Surge Alarm: -(0.20 mm + Thrust bearing float)
4.	Surge Trip: -(0.40 mm + Thrust bearing float)
5.	There still needs to be clarity obtained as to why the thrust recorded was 0.35 mm whilst the drawing stipulates 0.7mm - 0.80 mm.

This task should be scheduled for outage which has been moved to next year.

featuring up to five displays that can be connected for improved control room operation and
multi-monitoring applications.
PCS 7 v9
With its many new functions, SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 contributes to greater performance and
efficiency for the plant with new possibilities for upgrading or implementing new functions
otherwise limited by an obsolete PCS 7 v6 license.
APX-library
The APX control library will be transferred to PCS 7 v9 together with the control system
application program, thus enabling specific turbine control functions to operate as before.
Data Collector
If the existing system is equipped with a Data Collector it will be upgraded to be compatible
with Windows® 10. This will ensure that the CMS (Condition Monitoring System) and RDS
(Remote Diagnostic Service) will work to your benefit. 


Planning and Implementation:
Various options are available:
• Upgrade of the existing CMS-station (Condition Monitoring System)
• Spare parts kit
• Additional operator station
• Multiple displays
• Virus protection","Bokpoort-ST10","Ahmed Fahad","Upgrade","Short Opportunity","O&M","Closed",,"0 - Open","0 - Open","0 - Open","Open","2- Not Due","1/1/2027","9/16/2023","Major",,"Compliance","Bokpoort","Africa","South Africa","100%","1","0%","100%","0%","0%","0%","0%","No"

"SB20/2017E","3767","Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade","The Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade is a standardized concept to upgrade the
Windows® XP and Windows® 7 based PCS 7 v6/7/8 control system. Siemens will deliver a
system that has the same inclusive functionality with enhancements that result in minor
differences.
Windows® 10 Industrial PC
Siemens provides a new Siemens Industrial PC (Siemens IPC) with Windows® 10 pre-installed,
featuring up to five displays that can be connected for improved control room operation and
multi-monitoring applications.
PCS 7 v9
With its many new functions, SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 contributes to greater performance and
efficiency for the plant with new possibilities for upgrading or implementing new functions
otherwise limited by an obsolete PCS 7 v6 license.
APX-library
The APX control library will be transferred to PCS 7 v9 together with the control system
application program, thus enabling specific turbine control functions to operate as before.
Data Collector
If the existing system is equipped with a Data Collector it will be upgraded to be compatible
with Windows® 10. This will ensure that the CMS (Condition Monitoring System) and RDS
(Remote Diagnostic Service) will work to your benefit. 


Planning and Implementation:
Various options are available:
• Upgrade of the existing CMS-station (Condition Monitoring System)
• Spare parts kit
• Additional operator station
• Multiple displays
• Virus protection","Noor 1-ST10","Ahmed Fahad","Upgrade","Short Opportunity","O&M","Closed","It's a common issue between all plants.

"SB20/2017E","3768","Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade","The Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade is a standardized concept to upgrade the
Windows® XP and Windows® 7 based PCS 7 v6/7/8 control system. Siemens will deliver a
system that has the same inclusive functionality with enhancements that result in minor
differences.
Windows® 10 Industrial PC
Siemens provides a new Siemens Industrial PC (Siemens IPC) with Windows® 10 pre-installed,
featuring up to five displays that can be connected for improved control room operation and
multi-monitoring applications.
PCS 7 v9
With its many new functions, SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 contributes to greater performance and
efficiency for the plant with new possibilities for upgrading or implementing new functions
otherwise limited by an obsolete PCS 7 v6 license.
APX-library
The APX control library will be transferred to PCS 7 v9 together with the control system
application program, thus enabling specific turbine control functions to operate as before.
Data Collector
If the existing system is equipped with a Data Collector it will be upgraded to be compatible
with Windows® 10. This will ensure that the CMS (Condition Monitoring System) and RDS
(Remote Diagnostic Service) will work to your benefit. 


Planning and Implementation:
Various options are available:
• Upgrade of the existing CMS-station (Condition Monitoring System)
• Spare parts kit
• Additional operator station
• Multiple displays

"SB20/2017E","3769","Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade","The Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade is a standardized concept to upgrade the
Windows® XP and Windows® 7 based PCS 7 v6/7/8 control system. Siemens will deliver a
system that has the same inclusive functionality with enhancements that result in minor
differences.
Windows® 10 Industrial PC
Siemens provides a new Siemens Industrial PC (Siemens IPC) with Windows® 10 pre-installed,
featuring up to five displays that can be connected for improved control room operation and
multi-monitoring applications.
PCS 7 v9
With its many new functions, SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 contributes to greater performance and
efficiency for the plant with new possibilities for upgrading or implementing new functions
otherwise limited by an obsolete PCS 7 v6 license.
APX-library
The APX control library will be transferred to PCS 7 v9 together with the control system
application program, thus enabling specific turbine control functions to operate as before.
Data Collector
If the existing system is equipped with a Data Collector it will be upgraded to be compatible
with Windows® 10. This will ensure that the CMS (Condition Monitoring System) and RDS
(Remote Diagnostic Service) will work to your benefit. 


Planning and Implementation:
Various options are available:
• Upgrade of the existing CMS-station (Condition Monitoring System)
• Spare parts kit
• Additional operator station
• Multiple displays

differences.
Windows® 10 Industrial PC
Siemens provides a new Siemens Industrial PC (Siemens IPC) with Windows® 10 pre-installed,
featuring up to five displays that can be connected for improved control room operation and
multi-monitoring applications.
PCS 7 v9
With its many new functions, SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 contributes to greater performance and
efficiency for the plant with new possibilities for upgrading or implementing new functions
otherwise limited by an obsolete PCS 7 v6 license.
APX-library
The APX control library will be transferred to PCS 7 v9 together with the control system
application program, thus enabling specific turbine control functions to operate as before.
Data Collector
If the existing system is equipped with a Data Collector it will be upgraded to be compatible
with Windows® 10. This will ensure that the CMS (Condition Monitoring System) and RDS

"SB20/2017E","3771","Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade","The Windows® 10 and SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 Upgrade is a standardized concept to upgrade the
Windows® XP and Windows® 7 based PCS 7 v6/7/8 control system. Siemens will deliver a
system that has the same inclusive functionality with enhancements that result in minor
differences.
Windows® 10 Industrial PC
Siemens provides a new Siemens Industrial PC (Siemens IPC) with Windows® 10 pre-installed,
featuring up to five displays that can be connected for improved control room operation and
multi-monitoring applications.
PCS 7 v9
With its many new functions, SIMATIC PCS 7 v9 contributes to greater performance and
efficiency for the plant with new possibilities for upgrading or implementing new functions
otherwise limited by an obsolete PCS 7 v6 license.
APX-library
The APX control library will be transferred to PCS 7 v9 together with the control system
application program, thus enabling specific turbine control functions to operate as before.
Data Collector
If the existing system is equipped with a Data Collector it will be upgraded to be compatible
with Windows® 10. This will ensure that the CMS (Condition Monitoring System) and RDS
(Remote Diagnostic Service) will work to your benefit. 


Planning and Implementation:
Various options are available:
• Upgrade of the existing CMS-station (Condition Monitoring System)
• Spare parts kit
• Additional operator station
• Multiple displays
• Virus protection","Rabigh 2-DCS","Abduljabbar Sethar","Upgrade","Normal Operation","O&M","Closed","PC under discussion with OEM for the upgrade - attached latest communication.","0 - Open","0 - PR Raised","0 - Open","Open (Under Discussion OEM / PC)","2- Not Due","1/1/2027",,,,"Compliance","Rabigh 2","Red Sea","Saudi Arabia","100%","1","0%","100%","100%","0%","0%","0%","Yes"

"2332","3995","Confirm if safety valves are fitted downstream of the PRVs.","During the period of operation before modification can be carried out, GE recommends the following actions to help
mitigate the safety risk:
1. Confirm that the hydrogen supply PRVs are fully serviced and operating correctly.
2. If possible, reduce the supply pressure (upstream pressure) to the PRVs.
3. If possible, reduce the rate of flow by fitting an orifice plate upstream of the PRVs.
4. Ensure alarms of abnormal pressure downstream of the PRVs are functioning.
5. Ensure plant operators are informed of the risk and the importance of acting on alarms.
6. Limit the access close to the pressure reduction station to essential activities only.
7. Conduct a site-specific safety risk assessment to determine if any other potential containment actions are required.","Sohar 3-STG28","Abuthahir Jahaya","Inspection / Assessment (One Time)","Normal Operation","O&M","In Progress","Review of the system awaited from Site","2 - Not Required","2- Not Required","2 - Not Required","Open","0-Overdue","8/31/2022","10/1/2022","Type A",,"Compliance","Sohar 3","MEA","Oman","15%","1","100%","25%","0%","0%","100%","100%","No"

housing at the next planned major outage. The modification can be performed with the rotor in-situ.
To perform the modification, the shaft seal housing must be disassembled and brought into a qualified GE Global Repair
Shop or equivalently equipped shop with appropriate machine tooling and trained personnel. The work should be done
under the supervision of a GE engineer or supervisor.","Sohar 3-STG28","Abuthahir Jahaya","Condition Based Action / Upgrade","Major","O&M","Closed",,"0 - Open","0 - Open","0 - Open","Open","2- Not Due","3/18/2024","10/1/2022","Type A",,"Compliance","Sohar 3","MEA","Oman","100%","1","0%","100%","0%","0%","0%","0%","No"
